Home prices and apartment occupancy remained strong because of chronic supply limits. Office stayed under pressure from hybrid work, with higher vacancies and more tenant-friendly terms in non-prime buildings. Industrial cooled from its pandemic peak, but tight, last-mile locations near the urban core held up better than large, far-out boxes. Life-science demand stayed structurally important to the region\n\nMacro and local context\n\nBoston\n\nFor-sale housing: tight supply sustains prices\n\nBy year-end 2024, the median single-family price in Greater Boston rose about 6\n\nWhy does Boston keep running \n\nMultifamily: high occupancy, selective rent growth, flight-to-attainable\n\nThroughout 2024, stabilized apartment assets in Greater Boston kept occupancy around the mid-90s, with only modest movement. A mid-year read showed \n\nUnderwriting note: national research from CBRE showed core multifamily going-in cap rates near ~4.9% into Q4 2024. In Boston\n\nOffice: hybrid work reshapes demand and pricing power\n\nOffice saw the biggest stress. Foot-traffic and office visits improved during 2024 but stayed far below 2019 levels, and many tenants downsized. Asking rents held up in the top tier, but effective rents (after concessions) were softer, especially in commodity space. Sublease availability stayed elevated. The data fit a broader academic picture: peer-reviewed research shows that remote/hybrid work reduces office cash flows and long-run values, especially for lower-quality buildings. In Boston, this pulled investment toward \n\nFor cautious capital, two office angles stood out in 2024: (1) buying notes/REO at a deep discount where re-tenanting is practical, and (2) small-suite spec (plug-and-play floors for 10\n\nLife sciences: long-term anchor, short-term indigestion\n\nThe life-science \n\nIndustrial: growth cools, but last-mile and small-bay hold value\n\nAfter pandemic-era surges, 2024 brought slower leasing velocity and rising vacancy in Greater Boston industrial. A year-end report showed Metro Boston vacancy around the high-single digits, up from the lows, with big-box product in outlying parks the softest. Even so, small-bay and last-mile space inside the Route 128/95 ring stayed tighter because urban distribution is still costly to replace, and infill sites are scarce. Nationally, rents proved sticky even as vacancy rose, thanks to reduced new starts and replacement costs. For investors, the best industrial targets in 2024 were under-managed small-bay parks, older cinder-block buildings with clear-height flexibility, and covered-land plays near truck routes where future redevelopment adds an option value. \n\nPeer-reviewed work on e-commerce logistics reminds us that distribution networks keep reorganizing as online retail grows, often favoring facilities closer to consumers. That strengthens the case for scarce, well-located urban-infill industrial in Boston, even when headline vacancy rises across the metro. \n\nRental housing patterns: affordability stress and a pull to the suburbs\n\nTwo things stood out in 2024. First, Boston rents stayed among the highest in the U.S., and occupancy remained strong. Second, there was a gradual shift of renters toward nearby suburbs, where monthly costs are lower and new product is more attainable. Municipal data and media reporting highlighted the affordability gap: home prices and rents outpaced incomes for many households, sustaining rental demand and supporting suburban town center developments near commuter rail. For investors, that suggested durable demand for well-amenitized, mid-rise rentals within a 30\n\nCapital markets: rates, cap rates, and underwriting discipline\n\nThe 2024 financing market stayed tight. Debt costs were still high versus the 2010s, LTVs were conservative, and lenders focused on in-place cash flow, rollover risk, and sponsor strength. National research showed core multifamily cap rates hovering near ~4.9% into Q4 2024; in practice, many Boston trades were wider, especially for assets with lease-up or heavy capex. Peer-reviewed literature points out that cap rates respond to interest rates and perceived risk. For investors, this meant three practical steps: (1) buy at a basis that already reflects today\n\nBest opportunities in 2024 (Boston MSA)\n\n1) Workforce and \n\n2) Urban-infill small-bay industrial and last-mile logistics. Even as metro vacancy rose, small-bay inside Route 128/95 remained comparatively tight. Older, well-located buildings with dock access and adequate power leased to service trades, food distributors, and e-commerce nodes. Covered-land plays near truck corridors added upside. \n\n3) Select office-to-lab/light-R&D conversions and \n\n4) Condensed, high-efficiency condo infill. Because for-sale supply is structurally thin, small projects with smart layouts near transit, job centers, or universities continued to sell through\n\nSignificant patterns observed\n\nSupply inelasticity keeps a floor under housing. Geography and regulation restrict housing supply around Boston, which supports prices and rents even when mortgage rates are high. That pattern persisted throughout 2024. \n\nQuality bifurcation in office. Hybrid work shifted demand toward best-in-class space and away from commodity buildings. Utilization rose from pandemic lows but did not fully recover, reinforcing a two-tier office market. \n\n\n\nLife-science cyclicality on top of structural strength. The cluster remains a long-run advantage, but 2024 saw rising lab availability and slower leasing. This rewarded patient, experienced sponsors and conservative assumptions. \n\nTighter capital, tighter deals. With higher rates and cautious lenders, pricing power shifted to buyers with cash and operational skill. Cap-rate/interest-rate dynamics emphasized the value of basis and NOI growth over multiple expansion. \n\nBottom line\n\nIn 2024, Boston real estate rewarded investors who leaned into the region\n\nPeer-reviewed sources (at least 5)\n\nGupta, A., Mittal, V., & Van Nieuwerburgh, S.
