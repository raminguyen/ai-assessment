The task could not be fully completed. I successfully navigated to ChatGPT, logged in, and sent the first prompt (STEP1). However, I encountered persistent issues in extracting the full 1000-word essay generated by ChatGPT. Despite multiple attempts using `extract_structured_data`, scrolling, and `execute_js` with various selectors, the essay content remained truncated. This prevented me from proceeding to grade the essay (STEP2), revise it (STEP3), and deliver the final version (STEP4), as well as combining and saving the responses as requested. Therefore, the full user request could not be fulfilled.
