      "Capstone (4)": "Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding.",
      "Milestone (3)": "Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions.",
      "Milestone (2)": "Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown.",

      "Capstone (4)": "Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly.",
      "Milestone (3)": "Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning.",
      "Milestone (2)": "Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning.",

      "Capstone (4)": "Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position.",
      "Milestone (3)": "Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position.",
      "Milestone (2)": "Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa).",
      "Benchmark (1)": "Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins to identify some contexts when presenting a position."

      "Capstone (4)": "Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis).",

      "Milestone (2)": "Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes (consequences and implications) are identified clearly.",
      "Benchmark (1)": "Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes (consequences and implications) are oversimplified."
