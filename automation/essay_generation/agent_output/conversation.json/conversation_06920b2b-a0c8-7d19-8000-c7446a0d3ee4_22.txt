 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 4 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

			various perspectives and fully acknowledge the
			limits of position
			Revision:
			To address this and reach
			Capstone (4)
			in "Student's Position," I would refine the thesis to explicitly include a
			synthesis of opposing viewpoints
			within the conclusion. Additionally, I would expand on how external factors like
			shifting demographics
			or
			macro-environmental factors (e.g., inflation)
			might challenge the position, making it clear that the thesis acknowledges the
			uncertainty
			in the market.
			Example Revision:
			"While the Boston real estate market remains a robust investment environment, particularly in workforce housing and suburban rental markets, the overarching uncertainty around
			macroeconomic risks
			such as potential interest rate hikes or an economic slowdown makes long-term planning complex. Therefore, investors must balance short-term opportunities with an understanding that
			macro-environmental shifts
			might disrupt current growth patterns."
			5. Deepened Conclusion and Implications
			Original:
			The conclusion ties information together well but could benefit from
			deeper prioritization of outcomes
			and a more explicit evaluation of
			alternative outcomes
			Revision:
			To ensure the conclusion fully meets the
			Capstone (4)
			level, I would further prioritize
			implications and consequences
			by explaining how potential risks (e.g., regulatory changes, rising interest rates) could impact the investment strategies mentioned earlier. This would include a discussion of
			contingency planning
			for different risk scenarios, ensuring that the conclusion is more reflective of the
			future-facing critical thinking
			that the rubric demands.
			Example Revision:
			"The long-term outlook for Boston's real estate market remains positive for investors focused on workforce housing, suburban SFRs, and office-to-residential conversions. However, in light of the potential for
			inflationary pressures
			and rising interest rates,
			adaptive investment strategies
			should be considered. Investors must prepare for shifts in demand patterns and possible
			regulatory interventions
			by diversifying their portfolios and closely monitoring the evolving political landscape surrounding zoning and housing affordability."
			*[3676]<hr />
			Final Adjustments to Achieve 20/20
			Clarifying and Expanding Assumptions
			: More depth was added to the analysis of assumptions to ensure a thorough evaluation of the expert viewpoints, making the critique more rigorous.
			Alternative Expert Viewpoints
			: Alternative viewpoints were discussed, particularly around the
			future of mortgage rates
			and the possibility of a market rebound in the face of economic shifts. This makes the argument more dynamic.
			Deeper Synthesis
			: Greater synthesis was introduced, including a
			clear acknowledgment of opposing viewpoints
			and a broader
			discussion of the complexity of Boston's real estate market
			More Thoughtful Conclusion
			: The conclusion was expanded to reflect
			deeper implications and potential consequences
			, allowing it to fully tie together the analysis and demonstrate forward-looking critical thinking.
			Summary of Improvements to Reach 20/20:
			Explanation of Issues
			: Expanded socio-political context, making the issue clearer and more deeply rooted in national debates.
			Evidence
			: More thorough questioning of expert viewpoints, with expanded data synthesis and alternative perspectives integrated.
			Context & Assumptions
			: A more methodical analysis of assumptions and biases, including those embedded in the data and sources.
			Position
			: A more imaginative and sophisticated thesis that fully incorporates counterarguments and complexities.
			Conclusions
			: The conclusions were refined to logically tie together all evidence and implications, reflecting the nuanced evaluation of future outcomes.

Below is a five‑page full‑essay style analysis of the real‑estate investment market in the Boston Metropolitan Area for 2024, including key findings, investment opportunities, patterns, and insights. I have incorporated multiple data sources and peer‑reviewed (or academic) articles as citations.

---
### Introduction
The real‑estate market in the Greater Boston metropolitan area exhibits a complex interplay of strong fundamentals, elevated valuations, evolving demand patterns, and regulatory constraints. In 2024, the region saw moderating growth in some segments, continued investor interest in others, and persistent structural challenges around housing supply and affordability. For an investor, understanding not only macro‑trends but also local sub‑market dynamics is critical to discerning the best opportunities for real estate investment. This essay examines the 2024 market in Boston through four lenses: economic and demographic backdrop; supply and demand for rental and owner‑occupied housing; investment‑market metrics; and patterns and opportunities for investment. I conclude with key insights and recommended focus areas for investors in this region.

---
### Economic & Demographic Backdrop
The Boston metro area benefits from a highly educated workforce, strong institutional presence (universities, healthcare, biotech) and therefore relatively stable long‑term demand drivers. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s “Comprehensive Housing Market Analysis: Boston, Massachusetts” as of May 1, 2024, the unemployment rate in the Boston NECTA stood at 3.1 percent, down from 3.3 percent a year earlier. HUD User+1 Population growth was modest (estimated ~0.4 percent annually), driven partly by net in‑migration. HUD User  

However, the job‑growth rate in many sectors is decelerating: the report indicated job growth at just 0.5 % during the 12 months ending April 2024, compared with a 2.8 % gain a year earlier. HUD User  

Another factor is the shift in workplace habits — for instance, as outlined in a report on downtown Boston’s commercial real‑estate market, remote/hybrid work continues to reduce demand for prime office space, which may indirectly impact adjacent residential demand. Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation  

From a regulatory and supply‑side perspective, research shows that housing supply in Greater Boston is constrained by zoning, permitting complexity and local opposition, which perpetuates high price levels and limited elasticity. For example, a peer‑reviewed study found that relaxing multifamily zoning restrictions in Greater Boston could meaningfully increase supply and reduce rents. SSRN  

Taken together, the region’s strong economic base and limited housing elasticity suggest a favourable long‑term environment for real‑estate investment — albeit one where valuations are already elevated and supply‑side constraints raise risk of affordability‑related resistance.

---
### Supply, Demand & Market Metrics in 2024

#### Rental Housing
In 2024, the multifamily and rental market in the Boston area showed healthy performance, albeit with emerging signs of moderation. According to a second‑quarter 2024 report by MMG Real Estate Advisors, average effective rents for new leases in Boston rose 2.7 % year‑over‑year to $2,860 per month. In addition, net absorption of 2,191 units outpaced completions of 1,923 units during the quarter, indicating demand slightly exceeding new supply. MMG Real Estate Advisors  

The HUD report noted an average rent of $2,879 in Q1 2024 (up ~3 % year‑over‑year) and a rental vacancy rate of 6.2 percent (up from 4.9 percent in April 2020). HUD User+1 Sub‑markets such as the inner‑northern suburbs (Everett/Malden/Medford/Melrose) and areas along Route 1 North showed elevated construction activity. MMG Real Estate Advisors+1  

Moreover, a commercial brokerage report (Colliers) for 24Q4 noted that stabilized vacancy remained a strong 4.7 % and rent growth outpaced many other U.S. markets, although luxury class‑A units had rental growth of only ~1.7 % in 2024 due to new supply. Colliers  

The pattern is therefore one of robust but not explosive rental growth, with higher‑quality/luxury product facing more supply pressure, while mid- and workforce-housing segments remain tighter.

#### Owner-Occupied / Sales Market
For the sales market, conditions in 2024 remained tight but somewhat eased relative to earlier pandemic years. The HUD report reports a home-sales inventory of 1.5 months in April 2024 (up from 1.1 months a year earlier) but still abundant demand relative to supply. HUD User The average home price in the Boston HMA rose by 4 percent to about $824,600 for existing homes in the 12 months ending April 2024. HUD User+1  

However, high mortgage interest rates (around 7.2 percent as of April 2024) inhibited mobility, and tight supply remains a major constraint. HUD User  

Another key metric: in the multifamily investment market, investor activity remained resilient. For example, in Q2 2024 the number of properties traded increased, and investment volume in multifamily surpassed $1.2 billion in the first half of 2024. MMG Real Estate Advisors  

Taken together, the combination of limited supply, stable demand, and high valuations suggests the Boston area remains a seller-favouring environment — which is a mixed blessing for new investors because the entry cost is high but assets are unlikely to drastically devalue in the near-term (absent macro collapse).

#### Supply Pipeline & Construction Trends
The supply pipeline shows mixed signals. On one hand there are about 16,325 rental units under construction as of May 2024 in the Boston HMA with additional units in planning.HUD User+1 On the other hand reports indicate construction starts have already begun to decline:the MMG report noted that new completions in 2024 are forecast to be among lowest since2016(~7k units)and approximately40%of pipeline units are concentrated infour sub-markets.MMG Real Estate Advisors

In addition regulatory research indicates that local zoning remains restrictive inmany municipalities limiting by-right multifamily development thereby constraining supply response.SSRN

Thus,the supply side is under pressure:while abacklogofunits exists,new starts may have peakedandsupply growth may moderate which bodes wellfor occupancyand rent growth over medium term—but also implies elevated construction riskand costfor investors.

### Key Findings & Patterns

From data andresearch above,several recurring patterns emergeinBoston metropolitan real-estate marketin2024:

1.Valuations remain elevated but growth is moderating.Rental growth~2.7–3%andsales-price growth~4%are respectable but off boom years.High interest ratesand construction cost inflation are dampening upside.
2.Mid-and workforce-housing segments are outperforming luxury product.Luxury(class-A)apartments have experienced slower rent growth(~1.7%)andelevated vacancies(~8.3%)due to new supply.Colliers In contrast units targeted toward moderate income/leverage tenants(class B/C workforce housing)show stronger rent growth(~3%+)andtighter availability.
3.Strong institutional investor activity persists.Despite higher costofcapital investors are still participating at pre-pandemic levels(~$1+billion inmultifamily volumeinH12024)inpart drawnbyregion’s relative stability.MMG Real Estate Advisors
4.Supply constraints remain structural.Due to zoning permitting delays land costsand complex municipal veto processes,Boston region struggles to keep housing production instepwith household formation.Studiesshow relaxing zoning could meaningfully increase supply.SSRN+1
5.Geographicandsub-market nuanceis critical.Fastest rent growth sub-marketsin2Q24 included93North area(5.5%)and more affordable suburban fringe regions(Quincy/Milton/Randolph).MMG Real Estate Advisors Conversely some premium central Boston sub-markets(SouthBoston/Seaport)saw rent declines(~-0.6%)over same period.
6.Affordability pressures are rising.Cost-burdenfor both rentersand owners remains highinGreaterBoston which may increase politicaland regulatory risk while also shifting demand toward more modest housing product.A roundtable stakeholder study noted nearly half renter households pay more than one-third incomeonhousinginGreaterBoston.Bipartisan Policy Center
7.Macro factors(interest rates construction costs)are limiting upsidebut also limiting downside.Elevated financing costs reduce yield spreadsbut also make new competition less viable which may protect valueofexisting stock.

### Investment Opportunities & Strategic Recommendations

Based on foregoing analysis,several investment themes emergeas particularly promisinginBoston metropolitan areain2024.I highlight three broad categories:

**Workforce Multifamily / Mid-Market Rental Housing**  
Given relatively tight supplyand stronger rent growthinclass B/Cand workforce housing investmentsinthese tiers—particularlyinsub-markets showing strong absorption(e.g., Quincy/Milton/Randolph; Everett/Malden/Medford)—are attractive.The combinationofmoderate rents stable demandfrom young professionalsand students,and limited new-supply pressure makeformore favourable risk/return profiles than top-tier luxury.
When targeting such assets investors should focusonsub-marketswith strong transportation connectivity(MBTA access),proximitytojob hubs,and modest barriers to development.Be mindfulofconstruction cost inflationand factor sufficient yield margin to cover cap-rate expansion risk.

**Value-Add Conversions & Adaptive Reuse (Office→Residential)**

**Suburban Single-Family Rental(SFR)&Townhouse RentalsinEmerging Locations**  
With worker mobilityandaffordability pressures growing build-to-rentandsingle-family rental clustersinthe outer suburbs ofBostonare becoming more attractive.Sub-markets like Plymouth County or more affordable suburbs could offer value relative to central Boston.The rental market outside coreis absorbing supplyandmay benefitfrom spill-over demandas urban rents increase.TheHUDreportnoted vacancyinperipheral sub-markets like Plymouth County(~7.9%)andrental growth outside core.HUDUser
Investors should identify suburbswith strong commuter access(MBTA lines highway access),solid job-market growth,and demographic trends supporting rental growth(younger families remote-flex workers).Pricing entry may be lower improving yield potential.

### Risk Considerations

While opportunities are real,several risks must be managed:
- High costofcapital:Elevated interest rates mean cap-rates are compressedandaquisition financingis expensive.Return metrics must accountfordebt servicing refinancing risk cap-rate expansion.
- Constructionandcost inflation:Supply-side constraints exist,but development costs(materials labor permitting)are high.Mis-budgeting can erode returns.
- Regulatoryandzoning risk:Especiallyfor conversionordevelopment plays local municipal resistance(NIMBYism)andcomplex zoning(e.g.,multifamily restrictions)raise“entitlement risk”.Peer-research shows zoning relaxations would help supply,but many municipalities remain constrained.SSRN
- Affordability resistanceandtaregulation:Given high cost burdens thereisariskofregulatory backlash(e.g.,rent-control proposals tighter lendingorzoning oversight)which could affect returns.
- Sub-market variability:CentralBostonvsfringe suburbsshow divergent trends—what worksinonemay under-performin another.Investors must behyper-localintheir underwriting.

- **Differentiationbyproduct tier matters**:Luxury over-supply riskisreal;sweet spot liesinmid-market housing emerging sub-marketswheresupplyismore constrained valueismore accessible.
- **Supply constraintsare both challengeandanopportunity**:While restrictive zoning high costs limitnew development(raising entry cost),they also support valueofexisting stock.For investors ableto navigate developmentorconversion risk barriers themselves create less competition.
- **Demographics changing work patternsareshifting geography**:Growthinrental demandisincreasingly outside urban core,aidedbyremote/hybrid work affordability pressures.Suburbswithgood transit linksare benefitting.MMGreport highlighted areas suchas93North Quincy/Milton/Randolph out-performed.MMGRealEstateAdvisors
- **Macro factorsaretightening marginoferror**:Withhigher interest rates elevated costs underwriting disciplineis paramount.Investors must budget more conservatively assume moderate growth(2–4%annually)rather than6–10%seeninthe boom years build incontingencies.
- **Importanceofexit strategy**:Givenhigh valuations hold/lease strategiesmaymakemore sense than speculative appreciation plays.Riskofcap-rate expansion(asset value compression)isnot negligible.
