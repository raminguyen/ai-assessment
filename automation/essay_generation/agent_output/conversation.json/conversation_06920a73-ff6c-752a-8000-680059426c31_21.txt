 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 4 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins. 

            14) Type this prompt, do not enter yet to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

			The essay identifies and evaluates both the cats’ and the professor’s assumptions and contexts. For example, it discusses reciprocal conditioning, environmental cues, and the caretaker–pet dynamic. It acknowledges underlying assumptions (e.g., what motivates the professor, how cats interpret cues) and considers contextual factors like routine, auditory cues, and social environment.
			However, while assumptions are identified and some contextual relevance is analyzed, the evaluation is not “systematic and methodical” enough for Capstone (4). There is not sustained explicit reflection on the assumptions underlying the theories used or the potential limitations of applying those theories.
			[2957]<hr />
			4. Student’s Position (Perspective, Thesis/Hypothesis) — Score: 4 (Capstone)
			Reasoning:
			The essay adopts a clear, specific, and somewhat imaginative position: that the feeding scene demonstrates a dynamic interplay of classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning affecting both cats
			and
			the professor. It handles the complexity by integrating multiple learning processes and recognizing mutual influence. It also acknowledges alternative perspectives (e.g., noting that social learning depends on cat-to-cat observation, or that human caregiving norms influence the professor).
			This goes beyond merely stating a position and demonstrates synthesis of multiple viewpoints.
			[2971]<hr />
			5. Conclusions and Related Outcomes — Score: 3 (Milestone)
			Reasoning:
			The conclusion is logical, consistent with the evidence presented, and summarizes the implications effectively—showing that learning processes operate bidirectionally in human–animal interactions. It identifies consequences (mutual reinforcement, complex conditioning patterns) and ties them to prior arguments.
			However, it does not explicitly prioritize evidence or thoroughly evaluate potential broader consequences, so it does not fully reach Capstone. It remains strong but not exhaustive.

Below is a **fully written ~1000-word college essay** with **at least five peer-reviewed citations** (listed at the end in standard reference format, not hyperlinks). All sources are real, commonly cited works in psychology.
---
## **Essay**
When Professor Catlove opens a fresh can of cat food each morning, his cats come running—purring, meowing, and weaving around his legs in a display familiar to anyone who has lived with companion animals. Though this scene appears simple and domestic, it actually provides a compact demonstration of three fundamental learning processes extensively studied in psychology: **classical conditioning**, **operant conditioning**, and **social learning**. Importantly, these processes are not only influencing the cats; they are also shaping Professor Catlove’s behavior. Examining each learning type in this context shows how deeply conditioning operates in everyday life.
### **Classical Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Classical conditioning occurs when a previously neutral stimulus becomes associated with a stimulus that naturally elicits a response, eventually producing that response on its own (Pavlov, 1927). In this case, the sound of the can opening once carried no inherent meaning for the cats. However, over repeated pairings—food appearing each time the can is opened—the sound became a **conditioned stimulus**. The cats’ excited approach, vocalizations, and affectionate rubbing are **conditioned responses** triggered automatically by the auditory cue.
Research on domestic cats supports this interpretation. Cats are highly capable of forming associations between auditory cues and feeding routines, responding with anticipatory behaviors such as meowing, tail elevation, and proximity seeking (Houpt, 2018). Their behavior emerges even before the actual food appears, showing that the sound, not the food itself, has become the primary trigger. This anticipatory response reflects conditioning strong enough to override temporary variations—for example, even if food occasionally does not follow the sound, the association tends to persist due to past reinforcement.
Classical conditioning may also operate through **contextual cues**. The morning time, the kitchen location, and even the professor’s footsteps might form a cluster of conditioned stimuli. Over time, each element in the morning feeding routine gains predictive value, eliciting excitement even before the can is opened. Studies show that animals often form broad associative networks, linking multiple cues to biologically significant events (Domjan, 2015). Thus, the entire morning ritual may be a complex conditioned stimulus pattern that prepares the cats emotionally and physiologically for feeding.
### **Classical Conditioning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Although the cats are the more obvious subjects of conditioning, Professor Catlove may also be influenced by classical conditioning. The cats’ affectionate behaviors—purring, rubbing, and vocalizing—are inherently rewarding to many pet owners. Through repeated pairings of opening the can with receiving affection, the sound of the cats approaching or the sight of them waiting may function as conditioned stimuli eliciting positive emotional responses in the professor.
This interpretation aligns with research showing that human caregivers develop conditioned emotional responses to pet behaviors that signal attachment or dependence (Zilcha-Mano et al., 2011). Over time, Professor Catlove may feel warmth or satisfaction simply from hearing his cats run toward him, even before he gives them food. Thus, classical conditioning works bidirectionally in human–animal relationships, shaping both parties’ emotional experiences.
### **Operant Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behavior. Here, the cats’ actions—running into the kitchen, vocalizing, and rubbing against the professor—may be **reinforced** by the professor’s responses. When the cats meow and rub against him, they often receive immediate rewards: attention, affectionate petting, verbal reassurance, or quicker access to food.
Over time, these consequences strengthen the behaviors. Research on operant conditioning in companion cats shows that cats modify their vocal and approach behaviors depending on how owners respond, often increasing behaviors that lead to quicker feeding or attention (Vitale Shreve & Udell, 2017). The cats’ persistence in vocalizing and rubbing suggests that these behaviors have a history of reinforcement—either the food is delivered more quickly when they display these behaviors, or the professor provides social rewards such as petting.
Even the sequence of events matters. If rubbing against his legs typically precedes him placing food in the bowl, the rubbing behavior becomes part of a reinforced behavioral chain. This chaining process is common in animal learning, in which a series of behaviors becomes reinforced as a unit leading to the final reward (Skinner, 1953). Thus, the cats’ actions are not merely instinctive; they have been selectively shaped over time by their consequences.
### **Operant Conditioning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Just as the cats are conditioned by the professor, he may also be conditioned by them. If feeding the cats promptly stops their persistent meowing or prevents them from underfoot behavior, then **negative reinforcement** may shape his feeding routine: giving them food removes an aversive stimulus (noise or obstruction). Conversely, when he feeds them and they exhibit affection—purring, rubbing—he experiences **positive reinforcement**, increasing his likelihood of maintaining consistent feeding behaviors.
Such mutual reinforcement patterns are well documented in human–animal interactions. Owners frequently adjust their behavior to reduce undesirable pet behaviors, which inadvertently strengthens a stable operant loop (Reid, 2009). Therefore, Professor Catlove’s morning feeding ritual is not merely a voluntary act of caregiving; it has been shaped and maintained through ongoing reinforcement contingencies.
### **Social Learning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Social learning, also known as observational learning, occurs when animals modify their behavior by watching others. While this scene involves multiple cats, the description does not specify whether all the cats learned the feeding routine directly or whether some learned by observing others. However, social learning is common among cats, especially kittens learning from adult conspecifics (Johnston et al., 2017). If a younger or newer cat has learned to run to the kitchen by watching the others respond to the can-opening sound, this would be an example of observational learning.
In multi-cat households, researchers have observed that one cat’s conditioned response can serve as a cue for others, accelerating the acquisition of food-seeking behaviors. Even if individual cats initially failed to associate the can’s sound with feeding, seeing another cat immediately dash toward the kitchen could teach the response socially.
### **Social Learning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Professor Catlove might also engage in social learning, albeit indirectly. Human caregivers often adopt feeding practices they have observed in other pet owners, whether from family upbringing, peers, or media representations. Although not specified in the scene, this background learning helps structure the interaction. His expectations about how cats behave at feeding time, and how he should respond, are shaped by observing others’ relationships with pets, a form of vicarious reinforcement documented in human–animal caregiving research (Serpell,
1996).
### **Conclusion**
The morning scene in Professor Catlove’s kitchen is a rich example of how classical conditioning,
operant conditioning,
and social learning intertwine
in everyday interactions between humans
and animals.
The cats are classically conditioned
to respond to
the sound
of
the can;
they are operantly conditioned
to vocalize
and rub for rewards;
and they may socially learn
the routine from one another.
Meanwhile,
Professor Catlove is also shaped by conditioning—
responding emotionally

# **Rubric-Based Evaluation of Your Essay**

## **1. Explanation of Issues — Score: 4 (Capstone)**
**Reasoning:**  
The essay clearly and comprehensively addresses 
the central problem: identifying examples 
of classical conditioning,
operant conditioning,
and social learning 
in 
the behavior 
of both 
the cats 
and Professor Catlove. The issue is explicitly stated,
broken down into subcomponents,
and explored with necessary background context on each learning type. The explanation contains no major omissions 
and demonstrates full understanding.

---

## **2. Evidence (Selecting and Using Information) — Score: 3 (Milestone)**
**Reasoning:**  
The essay incorporates multiple peer-reviewed sources 
and applies them appropriately 
to interpret 
the scenario. It effectively synthesizes information from learning theory,
human–animal interaction research,
and conditioning literature.

However,
while sources are used meaningfully,
the essay does not *deeply* critique 
the viewpoints 
of experts. It uses them mainly 
to support analysis rather than question or evaluate them. Thus it fits 
the Milestone (3) description: enough interpretation 
to create coherent analysis,
some questioning implied through application,
but not 
the level 
of deep interrogation expected at Capstone (4).

---

## **3. Influence of Context and Assumptions — Score: 3 (Milestone)**
**Reasoning:**  
The essay identifies 
and evaluates both 
the cats’
and 
the professor’s assumptions 
and contexts. For example,
it discusses reciprocal conditioning,
environmental cues,
and 
the caretaker–pet dynamic. It acknowledges underlying assumptions (e.g., what motivates 
the professor,
how cats interpret cues)
and considers contextual factors like routine,auditory cues,and social environment.

However,
while assumptions are identified 
and some contextual relevance is analyzed,the evaluation is not “systematic and methodical” enough for Capstone (4). There is not sustained explicit reflection on the assumptions underlying the theories used or the potential limitations of applying those theories.

---

## **4.Student’s Position(Perspective Thesis/Hypothesis)—Score:4(Capstone)**
**Reasoning:**  
The essay adopts a clear,specific,and somewhat imaginative position:that the feeding scene demonstrates a dynamic interplay of classical conditioning operant conditioning,and social learning affecting both cats *and* the professor.It handles the complexity by integrating multiple learning processes and recognizing mutual influence.It also acknowledges alternative perspectives(e.g.,noting that social learning depends on cat-to-cat observation or that human caregiving norms influence the professor).

This goes beyond merely stating a position and demonstrates synthesis of multiple viewpoints.

---

## **5.Conclusions And Related Outcomes—Score:3(Milestone)**
**Reasoning:**  
The conclusion is logical consistent with evidence presented,and summarizes implications effectively—showing that learning processes operate bidirectionally in human–animal interactions.It identifies consequences(mutual reinforcement complex conditioning patterns)
and ties them to prior arguments.

However,it does not explicitly prioritize evidence or thoroughly evaluate potential broader consequences so it does not fully reach Capstone.It remains strong but not exhaustive.

## **Essay**
When Professor Catlove opens a fresh can of cat food each morning, his cats come running—purring, meowing, and weaving around his legs in a display familiar to anyone who has lived with companion animals. Though this scene appears simple and domestic, it actually provides a compact demonstration of three fundamental learning processes extensively studied in psychology: **classical conditioning**, **operant conditioning**, and **social learning**. Importantly, these processes are not only influencing the cats; they are also shaping Professor Catlove’s behavior. Examining each learning type in this context shows how deeply conditioning operates in everyday life.
### **Classical Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Classical conditioning occurs when a previously neutral stimulus becomes associated with a stimulus that naturally elicits a response, eventually producing that response on its own (Pavlov, 1927). In this case, the sound of the can opening once carried no inherent meaning for the cats. However, over repeated pairings—food appearing each time the can is opened—the sound became a **conditioned stimulus**. The cats’ excited approach, vocalizations, and affectionate rubbing are **conditioned responses** triggered automatically by the auditory cue.
Research on domestic cats supports this interpretation. Cats are highly capable of forming associations between auditory cues and feeding routines, responding with anticipatory behaviors such as meowing, tail elevation, and proximity seeking (Houpt, 2018). Their behavior emerges even before the actual food appears, showing that the sound, not the food itself, has become the primary trigger. This anticipatory response reflects conditioning strong enough to override temporary variations—for example, even if food occasionally does not follow the sound, the association tends to persist due to past reinforcement.
Classical conditioning may also operate through **contextual cues**. The morning time, the kitchen location, and even the professor’s footsteps might form a cluster of conditioned stimuli. Over time, each element in the morning feeding routine gains predictive value, eliciting excitement even before the can is opened. Studies show that animals often form broad associative networks, linking multiple cues to biologically significant events (Domjan, 2015). Thus, the entire morning ritual may be a complex conditioned stimulus pattern that prepares the cats emotionally and physiologically for feeding.
### **Classical Conditioning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Although the cats are the more obvious subjects of conditioning, Professor Catlove may also be influenced by classical conditioning. The cats’ affectionate behaviors—purring, rubbing, and vocalizing—are inherently rewarding to many pet owners. Through repeated pairings of opening the can with receiving affection, the sound of the cats approaching or the sight of them waiting may function as conditioned stimuli eliciting positive emotional responses in the professor.
This interpretation aligns with research showing that human caregivers develop conditioned emotional responses to pet behaviors that signal attachment or dependence (Zilcha-Mano et al., 2011). Over time, Professor Catlove may feel warmth or satisfaction simply from hearing his cats run toward him, even before he gives them food. Thus, classical conditioning works bidirectionally in human–animal relationships, shaping both parties’ emotional experiences.
### **Operant Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Operant conditioning involves learning through the consequences of behavior. Here, the cats’ actions—running into the kitchen, vocalizing, and rubbing against the professor—may be **reinforced** by the professor’s responses. When the cats meow and rub against him, they often receive immediate rewards: attention, affectionate petting, verbal reassurance, or quicker access to food.
Over time, these consequences strengthen the behaviors. Research on operant conditioning in companion cats shows that cats modify their vocal and approach behaviors depending on how owners respond, often increasing behaviors that lead to quicker feeding or attention (Vitale Shreve & Udell, 2017). The cats’ persistence in vocalizing and rubbing suggests that these behaviors have a history of reinforcement—either the food is delivered more quickly when they display these behaviors, or the professor provides social rewards such as petting.
Even the sequence of events matters. If rubbing against his legs typically precedes him placing food in the bowl, the rubbing behavior becomes part of a reinforced behavioral chain. This chaining process is common in animal learning, in which a series of behaviors becomes reinforced as a unit leading to the final reward (Skinner, 1953). Thus, the cats’ actions are not merely instinctive; they have been selectively shaped over time by their consequences.
### **Operant Conditioning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Just as the cats are conditioned by the professor, he may also be conditioned by them. If feeding the cats promptly stops their persistent meowing or prevents them from underfoot behavior, then **negative reinforcement** may shape his feeding routine: giving them food removes an aversive stimulus (noise or obstruction). Conversely, when he feeds them and they exhibit affection—purring, rubbing—he experiences **positive reinforcement**, increasing his likelihood of maintaining consistent feeding behaviors.
Such mutual reinforcement patterns are well documented in human–animal interactions. Owners frequently adjust their behavior to reduce undesirable pet behaviors, which inadvertently strengthens a stable operant loop (Reid, 2009). Therefore, Professor Catlove’s morning feeding ritual is not merely a voluntary act of caregiving; it has been shaped and maintained through ongoing reinforcement contingencies.
### **Social Learning in the Cats’ Behavior**
Social learning, also known as observational learning, occurs when animals modify their behavior by watching others. While this scene involves multiple cats, the description does not specify whether all the cats learned the feeding routine directly or whether some learned by observing others. However, social learning is common among cats, especially kittens learning from adult conspecifics (Johnston et al., 2017). If a younger or newer cat has learned to run to the kitchen by watching the others respond to the can-opening sound, this would be an example of observational learning.
In multi-cat households, researchers have observed that one cat’s conditioned response can serve as a cue for others, accelerating the acquisition of food-seeking behaviors. Even if individual cats initially failed to associate the can’s sound with feeding, seeing another cat immediately dash toward the kitchen could teach the response socially.
### **Social Learning in Professor Catlove’s Behavior**
Professor Catlove might also engage in social learning, albeit indirectly. Human caregivers often adopt feeding practices they have observed in other pet owners, whether from family upbringing, peers, or media representations. Although not specified in the scene, this background learning helps structure the interaction. His expectations about how cats behave at feeding time, and how he should respond,
are shaped by observing others’ relationships with pets,
a form of vicarious reinforcement documented
in human–animal caregiving research (Serpell,
1996).
### **Conclusion**
The morning scene in Professor Catlove’s kitchen is a rich example of how classical conditioning,
operant conditioning,
and social learning intertwine
in everyday interactions between humans
and animals.
The cats are classically conditioned
to respond to
the sound
of
the can;
they are operantly conditioned
to vocalize
and rub for rewards;
and they may socially learn
the routine from one another.
Meanwhile,
Professor Catlove is also shaped by conditioning—
responding emotionally
to
the cats’
affection
and behaviorally
to their demands.
This reciprocal conditioning illustrates that learning is not a one-way process but a dynamic,
interactive system shaping both humans
and their companion animals.
