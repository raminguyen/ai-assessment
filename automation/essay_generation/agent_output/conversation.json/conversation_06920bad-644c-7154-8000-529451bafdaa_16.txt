 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

Critical thinking is a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. Evaluators are encouraged to assign a zero to any work sample or collection of work that does not meet benchmark (cell one) level performance. Explanation of issues: Capstone (4): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding. Milestone (3): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions. Milestone (2): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown. Benchmark (1): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated without clarification or description. Evidence (Selecting and using information to investigate a point of view or conclusion): Capstone (4): Information is taken from source(s) with enough.  

            12) Type this prompt, do not enter yet interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly. Milestone (3): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning. Milestone (2): Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning. Benchmark (1): Information is taken from source(s) without any interpretation/evaluation. Viewpoints of experts are taken as fact, without question. Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins. 

            13) Type this prompt, do not enter yet to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

		Social
		Learning
		in
		the
		Professor’s
		Behavior
		Professor
		Catlove
		may
		also
		engage
		in
		social
		learning,
		albeit
		in
		subtler
		form.
		His
		expectations
		about
		feline
		behavior
		may
		be
		shaped
		by
		cultural
		narratives,
		observational
		experiences,
		or
		prior
		exposure
		to
		other
		pet
		owners.
		For
		instance,
		he
		may
		have
		learned
		from
		observing
		other
		cat
		owners
		that
		cats
		typically
		respond
		to
		feeding
		cues
		with
		vocalization
		and
		affection.
		This
		knowledge
		informs
		his
		interpretation
		of
		his
		cats’
		behavior,
		reinforcing
		his
		own
		feeding
		practices.
		In
		this
		way,
		social
		learning
		contributes
		to
		the
		professor’s
		understanding
		and
		management
		of
		the
		feeding
		routine.
		Interplay
		of
		Conditioning
		Processes
		The
		scene
		in
		Professor
		Catlove’s
		kitchen
		illustrates
		the
		interplay
		of
		classical
		conditioning,
		operant
		conditioning,
		and
		social
		learning.
		Classical
		conditioning
		explains
		the
		anticipatory
		responses
		to
		the
		can-opening
		sound,
		operant
		conditioning
		accounts
		for
		the
		persistence
		and
		refinement
		of
		affectionate
		behaviors
		reinforced
		by
		food
		delivery,
		and
		social
		learning
		highlights
		the
		role
		of
		observation
		and
		imitation
		in
		shaping
		group
		behavior.
		Importantly,
		these
		processes
		are
		not
		mutually
		exclusive;
		rather,
		they
		operate
		simultaneously,
		creating
		dynamic
		system
		of
		reciprocal
		reinforcement
		between
		cats
		and
		professor.
		This
		interplay
		underscores
		the
		complexity
		of
		everyday
		learning.
		What
		appears
		to
		be
		simple
		feeding
		routine
		is,
		in
		fact,
		microcosm
		of
		psychological
		principles.
		The
		cats’
		behavior
		reflects
		both
		associative
		and
		consequence-based
		learning,
		while
		the
		professor’s
		actions
		are
		shaped
		by
		reinforcement
		and
		cultural
		expectations.
		Together,
		they
		form
		mutually
		reinforcing
		cycle
		of
		conditioned
		behavior.
		Broader
		Implications
		Analyzing
		this
		vignette
		has
		broader
		implications
		for
		understanding
		human–animal
		interactions.
		Domestic
		animals
		provide
		natural
		laboratory
		for
		observing
		conditioning
		processes,
		as
		their
		behaviors
		are
		closely
		tied
		to
		human
		routines.
		Recognizing
		the
		role
		of
		conditioning
		can
		help
		pet
		owners
		manage
		behaviors
		more
		effectively,
		fostering
		positive
		interactions
		and
		reducing
		problematic
		behaviors.
		Moreover,
		the
		reciprocal
		nature
		of
		conditioning
		highlights
		the
		bidirectional
		influence
		between
		humans
		and
		animals:
		just
		as
		humans
		shape
		animal
		behavior,
		animals
		shape
		human
		routines
		and
		emotional
		states.
		Conclusion
		The
		morning
		ritual
		of
		Professor
		Catlove
		and
		his
		cats
		exemplifies
		the
		pervasive
		influence
		of
		conditioning
		and
		learning
		in
		everyday
		life.

# Conditioning and Learning in Professor Catlove’s Kitchen

### Introduction
The brief vignette of Professor Catlove opening a can of cat food and his cats rushing into the kitchen purring, meowing, and rubbing against his legs provides a rich illustration of fundamental principles in behavioral psychology. Though seemingly mundane, this everyday interaction encapsulates classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning processes. Importantly, both the cats and the professor are participants in this reciprocal system of conditioned behavior. By analyzing the scene through these three theoretical lenses, we can better understand how associative learning, reinforcement, and observational processes shape human–animal interactions.

### Classical Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior
Classical conditioning, first described by Ivan Pavlov, involves learning through association: a neutral stimulus becomes linked with an unconditioned stimulus, eventually eliciting a conditioned response. In this case, the sound of the can opening functions as a conditioned stimulus. Initially, the can-opening sound is neutral, but repeated pairings with the delivery of food (the unconditioned stimulus) lead the cats to associate the sound with feeding. As a result, the cats exhibit anticipatory behaviors—running into the kitchen, vocalizing, and rubbing against Professor Catlove’s legs—which serve as conditioned responses.
This anticipatory excitement is not merely anecdotal; research demonstrates that animals readily form associations between auditory cues and food delivery. For example, studies on feline learning show that cats can develop strong conditioned responses to feeding-related stimuli, such as the sound of a can opener or the rustling of a food bag (McComb et al., 2009). The cats’ purring and meowing thus represent physiological and behavioral manifestations of conditioned anticipation. Their behavior exemplifies the predictive nature of classical conditioning: the sound signals imminent reward, triggering emotional arousal and approach behavior.

### Classical Conditioning in the Professor’s Behavior
Interestingly, classical conditioning also applies to Professor Catlove. Over time, the professor may associate the cats’ affectionate behaviors—purring, rubbing, and vocalizing—with the act of feeding them. These behaviors, though initially incidental, become conditioned stimuli that elicit positive emotional responses in the professor. The cats’ affectionate displays may reinforce his sense of companionship and satisfaction, conditioning him to feel pleasure when feeding them. In this way, the professor’s own emotional state becomes conditioned by the predictable sequence of feline responses.

### Operant Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior
Operant conditioning, as formulated by B.F. Skinner, involves learning through consequences: behaviors are strengthened or weakened depending on reinforcement or punishment. In this scenario, the cats’ affectionate behaviors—rubbing against Professor Catlove’s legs and vocalizing—can be understood as operant behaviors maintained by reinforcement. When the cats engage in these behaviors, they reliably receive food. The delivery of food serves as positive reinforcement, increasing the likelihood that the cats will continue to exhibit these behaviors in future feeding contexts.
Moreover, the cats’ persistence in vocalizing and rubbing may also reflect shaping. Initially, random behaviors may have coincided with feeding, but over time, the professor may have responded more consistently to specific behaviors, such as meowing or rubbing. These behaviors are selectively reinforced, becoming more prominent in the cats’ repertoire. Operant conditioning thus explains not only the persistence but also the refinement of the cats’ feeding-related behaviors.

### Operant Conditioning in the Professor’s Behavior
The professor’s actions are also subject to operant conditioning. Feeding the cats terminates their insistent meowing and rubbing, which could otherwise be mildly aversive. In this sense, the professor’s behavior is negatively reinforced: by opening the can and providing food, he removes the aversive stimulus of persistent feline demands. Simultaneously, the affectionate behaviors of the cats may serve as positive reinforcement, encouraging the professor to continue feeding them promptly. Thus, his morning routine is shaped by both positive and negative reinforcement contingencies.

### Social Learning in the Cats’ Behavior
Social learning theory, advanced by Albert Bandura, emphasizes learning through observation and imitation. While cats are not traditionally considered strong imitators in the same way as primates, research indicates that they can learn socially, particularly in domestic contexts. In multi-cat households, one cat’s behavior—such as running to the kitchen at the sound of the can—may serve as a model for others. Younger or less experienced cats may observe the responses of their peers and imitate them, thereby acquiring the conditioned association more rapidly.
For example, if one cat consistently responds to the can-opening sound by running to the kitchen, others may follow suit—even before forming association independently. This process accelerates learning and creates synchronized group behavior. Social facilitation—a related concept—suggests that presence of conspecifics increases likelihood of certain behaviors; thus collective rush into kitchen may be partly explained by social learning dynamics.

### Social Learning in Professor’s Behavior
Professor Catlove may also engage in social learning—albeit subtler form; his expectations about feline behavior may be shaped by cultural narratives/observational experiences/prior exposure to other pet owners (e.g., observing other cat owners whose pets respond similarly). This knowledge informs his interpretation/management practices; thus social learning contributes to understanding/management routine.

### Interplay of Conditioning Processes
The scene illustrates interplay among classical/operant/social learning: classical explains anticipatory responses; operant accounts for persistence/refinement via reinforcement; social highlights observation/imitation shaping group response—not mutually exclusive but simultaneous/dynamic system reciprocal reinforcement between cats/professor.

### Broader Implications
Analyzing vignette has broader implications for understanding human–animal interactions; domestic animals provide natural laboratory for observing conditioning processes; recognizing role helps manage/foster positive interactions/reduce problematic ones; reciprocal nature highlights bidirectional influence between humans/animals (humans shape animal behavior; animals shape human routines/emotional states).

### Conclusion
The morning ritual exemplifies pervasive influence conditioning/learning everyday life: classical explains anticipatory excitement (can-opening); operant accounts for reinforcement affectionate/feeding practices; social highlights observation shaping group responses; both participants mutually conditioned via repeated interactions—a microcosm illustrating psychological principles governing human–animal relationships/offering insight mechanisms structuring daily life.
