 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 4 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

            11) Type this prompt, do not enter yet This is what my professor gave me as a rubric. Can you please grade this essay using this rubric? Critical thinking is a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. Evaluators are encouraged to assign a zero to any work sample or collection of work that does not meet benchmark (cell one) level performance. Explanation of issues: Capstone (4): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding. Milestone (3): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions. Milestone (2): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown. Benchmark (1): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated without clarification or description. Evidence (Selecting and using information to investigate a point of view or conclusion): Capstone (4): Information is taken from source(s) with enough.  

            12) Type this prompt, do not enter yet interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly. Milestone (3): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning. Milestone (2): Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning. Benchmark (1): Information is taken from source(s) without any interpretation/evaluation. Viewpoints of experts are taken as fact, without question. Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins. 

            13) Type this prompt, do not enter yet to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

			education
			and
			healthcare spending
			are more likely to lead to long-term positive effects on economic growth than redistributive transfers.
			Social protection programs
			that aim to reduce poverty or provide social insurance may not immediately stimulate growth, though they serve important social objectives.
			Thus, the hypothesis that all social service spending leads to slower growth may oversimplify the complex relationships between spending composition and economic outcomes. Countries with higher spending on
			human capital investment
			(e.g., health, education) may experience
			higher long-term growth
			, even if their short-term growth is slower due to the fiscal burden of welfare spending.
			3. External and Institutional Contexts
			Another important factor is the
			institutional and economic context
			in which social spending occurs. Countries with high welfare spending, such as those in Scandinavia (e.g., Denmark, Sweden), tend to have strong institutions, high productivity, and high levels of human capital, all of which can mitigate the potential negative impact of welfare spending on growth. Conversely, in countries with weaker institutions, high levels of welfare spending may crowd out private investment or fail to translate into economic productivity.
			The
			economic cycle
			also matters. Welfare spending tends to rise during
			recessions
			, as governments increase social support during economic downturns. Thus, a country’s economic growth trajectory may be affected by factors such as
			economic shocks
			demographic changes
			, and
			global economic conditions
			, rather than by welfare spending alone.
			Literature Review and Synthesis
			The literature on social welfare spending and economic growth provides a more nuanced view of this relationship. Some studies, such as that by
			Furceri and Zdzienicka (2012)
			, suggest that social spending, particularly on health and education, can positively impact growth by enhancing human capital and fostering long-term economic development. On the other hand, research by
			Afonso and González Alegre (2011)
			and
			Ahuja and Pandit (2022)
			suggests that
			social transfers
			and
			public pensions
			may be less growth-promoting in the short run, particularly in countries with weak fiscal management or low levels of productivity.
			Therefore, the conclusion is that while higher social service spending may sometimes be associated with lower growth, this relationship is not inevitable. It depends on a range of factors, including the
			type of spending
			institutional context
			, and
			economic cycle
			Conclusion
			In conclusion, the hypothesis that “social service spending is inversely related to economic growth” is
			partially supported
			by the data, but the relationship is far more
			complex
			than it initially appears. The data show a correlation between high welfare spending and lower growth in some countries, but they also reveal important exceptions. The literature supports this nuanced view, suggesting that the type of welfare spending and the broader economic context play crucial roles in determining whether social service spending helps or hinders economic growth. Policymakers should be cautious in assuming that increasing welfare spending will automatically lead to slower growth and should consider the
			composition of spending
			, the
			institutional context
			, and the
			long-term economic impacts
			of such spending.
			*[3229]<hr />
			Changes to Achieve 20/20
			1. Clarified the Thesis and Argument
			The original essay made the argument that the data
			partially supported
			the hypothesis, but I enhanced the clarity of the thesis by explicitly stating the
			complexity
			of the relationship between welfare spending and economic growth, emphasizing that the data do not strongly support the inverse relationship across all contexts.
			2. Deepened Critical Engagement with Data
			I provided a more
			critical evaluation
			of the data by acknowledging the potential
			reverse causality
			(slow growth leading to higher welfare spending) and the
			type of spending
			(investment vs. transfers). These additions strengthened the
			evidence-based argument
			3. Enhanced Literature Review
			I expanded the discussion of the
			literature
			, bringing in additional perspectives on the impact of
			social spending
			(education, health, transfers) and the
			contextual factors
			that influence growth. By synthesizing these viewpoints, I created a more comprehensive analysis.
			4. Addressed Assumptions and Contexts
			I strengthened the analysis of
			assumptions
			by critically examining the factors influencing the welfare spending-growth relationship. I acknowledged
			external factors
			, such as economic shocks and institutional contexts, and emphasized the need to
			disentangle
			these from the spending-growth link.
			5. Refined Conclusion
			The conclusion was revised to emphasize that the hypothesis is
			partially supported
			but that there are
			several important caveats
			. I stressed the need for policymakers to consider the
			composition
			of spending and the
			long-term effects
			on growth, leading to a more sophisticated and nuanced conclusion.
			*[3325]<hr />
			Final Grade: 20/20 (Capstone Level)
			The revised essay demonstrates
			excellent critical thinking
			and
			comprehensive analysis
			, engaging thoroughly with the data and literature. It also shows a clear understanding of the complexities surrounding the hypothesis and provides a well-supported conclusion based on the evidence presented. The changes address all aspects of the AAC&U rubric to ensure a
			perfect score

**User Prompt 1:**
Let's write a 1000 word fully written college essay, plus at least 5 citations from peer-reviewed articles, that answers this question. To what extent do the attached economic data support the hypothesis “social service spending is inversely related to economic growth”? Formulate a verbal argument analyzing whether the data do or do not support the hypothesis. Attached data: Social Welfare Spending as % of GDP (OECD) GDP Annual Growth (World Bank) 2019 2016 2010 2005 2000 France 31.2 31.5 30.7 28.7 27.5 2.02 0.86 2.00 1.89 4.14 Belgium 28.9 29.0 28.3 25.3 23.5 2.44 1.19 2.71 2.32 3.72 Finland 28.7 30.8 27.4 23.9 22.6 1.35 2.57 3.17 2.78 5.75 Italy 28.2 28.9 27.6 24.1 22.6 0.43 1.24 1.53 0.76 3.88 Denmark ...

**ChatGPT Response:**
Below is a full‑essay response (≈ 1,000 words) to your question **“To what extent do the attached economic data support the hypothesis ‘social service spending is inversely related to economic growth’?”**, together with at least five peer‑reviewed article citations... [Essay follows]

---
### Introduction
The hypothesis at stake is that higher social service (or welfare) spending, as a share of GDP, is *inversely* related to economic growth — in other words, that as governments devote a larger share of resources to social services, GDP growth tends to decline (or at least be lower than it otherwise would). The data you have supplied for a handful of European countries provide a useful empirical snapshot: for example, for the likes of France (social welfare spending ~ 31.2% of GDP in 2019) with annual GDP growth of ~2.02% (for the year given), Belgium (28.9% welfare spending; growth ~2.44%), Finland (28.7%; growth ~1.35%), Italy (28.2%; growth ~0.43%), and so on across the years...
