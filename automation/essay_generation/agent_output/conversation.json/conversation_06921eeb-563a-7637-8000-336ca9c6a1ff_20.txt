 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

	Belgium's trajectory further complicates the inverse hypothesis. Social spending rose from 23.5% in 2000 to 28.9% by 2019—a substantial 5.4 percentage point increase. According to the hypothesis, this should correlate with declining growth rates. Instead, Belgium grew at 3.72% in 2000 and 2.44% in 2019—a decline, but one occurring across a period when spending at 28.3% (2010) corresponded with 2.71% growth. The highest post-crisis growth rate (2.71% in 2010) occurred when spending had increased substantially from its 2000 baseline, directly contradicting predictions of inverse correlation.
	C. Finland: The Nordic Puzzle
	Finland presents perhaps the most theoretically challenging case. The country achieved its highest observed growth rate of 5.75% in 2000 with social spending at 22.6%—seemingly supporting the inverse hypothesis. However, Finland sustained 3.17% growth in 2010 when spending had increased to 27.4%, demonstrating that elevated social expenditure can coexist with robust expansion. By 2019, spending decreased slightly to 28.7% while growth collapsed to 1.35%, contradicting the prediction that reduced spending should stimulate growth. Finland's experience demonstrates that social spending levels alone poorly predict growth outcomes.
	D. Cross-National Comparison: No Consistent Inverse Pattern
	Examining 2010 data (post-financial crisis) reveals substantial growth variation among countries with similar social spending profiles. If spending inversely determined growth, countries with comparable expenditure levels should show similar growth rates. Instead, the data reveal heterogeneity: multiple countries achieved moderate growth (2.00-2.71%) despite social spending ranging from 28% to 31% of GDP. This variation suggests that factors beyond aggregate spending levels—institutional quality, labor market structure, innovation capacity, global demand conditions—exert stronger influence on growth outcomes than social expenditure per se.
	III. Rigorous Scholarly Evidence: Questioning the Inverse Hypothesis
	A. The Furceri-Zdzienicka Multiplier Finding
	The most methodologically sophisticated contradiction of the inverse hypothesis comes from Furceri and Zdzienicka's (2012) panel analysis of OECD countries. Using vector autoregression techniques and impulse response functions, they found that social spending generates positive multiplier effects: a 1% increase in social spending as a share of GDP raises output by approximately 0.1 percentage points, corresponding to a fiscal multiplier of 0.6. This finding directly refutes the inverse hypothesis by demonstrating that social expenditure stimulates rather than constrains economic activity. The mechanisms include: (1) consumption support maintaining aggregate demand, (2) automatic stabilization during downturns, and (3) productivity enhancements through human capital investment.
	Critical evaluation of this evidence:
	I weight Furceri and Zdzienicka's findings heavily because they explicitly address endogeneity (the bidirectional causality problem that bedevils simple correlations), employ contemporary econometric techniques suitable for dynamic panel data, and cover sufficient temporal variation to distinguish short-run cyclical effects from long-run structural relationships. However, their findings may not generalize beyond OECD contexts, and multiplier effects likely vary with economic conditions (larger during recessions when private demand is depressed).
	B. Lindert's Historical "Free Lunch" Puzzle
	Peter Lindert's (2004) landmark historical study

# Social Welfare Spending and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis

## I. Introduction and Explicit Framing of the Research Question
The hypothesis that "social service spending is inversely related to economic growth" represents a foundational claim in contemporary policy debates about the welfare state. This hypothesis asserts a negative causal relationship: as governments allocate greater proportions of GDP to social programs—including pensions, healthcare, unemployment benefits, and family support—economic growth necessarily declines due to reduced private investment, weakened work incentives, and increased tax burdens. This essay critically examines whether OECD cross-national data on social welfare spending (as percentage of GDP) and GDP annual growth rates across five time periods (2000, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2019) support this inverse relationship hypothesis.

**Explicit statement of analytical assumptions:** This analysis operates under several key assumptions that merit transparent acknowledgment. First, I assume that peer-reviewed econometric studies employing rigorous panel data methodologies provide more reliable causal inference than simple bivariate correlations observable in raw data. Second, I assume that the OECD data accurately measure social expenditure and economic growth, though measurement challenges exist (e.g., off-budget spending, informal economies). Third, I assume that twenty-year timeframes capture meaningful patterns while acknowledging that longer historical perspectives might reveal different dynamics. Fourth, I prioritize evidence based on: (1) methodological rigor, (2) sample size and temporal coverage, (3) explicit attention to causality and endogeneity, and (4) peer review quality. These assumptions shape my interpretation and any reader may reasonably question them.

**Limits of this position:** This analysis cannot definitively establish causation from the cross-sectional data alone, cannot determine optimal spending levels, does not account for institutional quality variations that moderate spending effects, and examines only a subset of OECD countries during a specific historical period marked by extraordinary volatility (the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent recovery). The data cannot isolate spending composition effects (education versus pensions) that research suggests matter significantly.

## II. Patterns in the Empirical Data: What Do the Numbers Actually Show?
### A. France: High Spending Across Varied Growth Contexts
France maintained consistently high social welfare spending throughout the observation period, ranging from 27.5% of GDP in 2000 to 31.2% by 2019—among the highest levels in the OECD. Yet France's economic growth exhibited substantial variation that appears disconnected from spending levels. The country achieved 4.14% growth in 2000 when spending was at its lowest point (27.5%), suggesting inverse correlation. However, France also posted 2.00% growth in 2010 with spending at 30.7%, and 2.02% growth in 2019 at 31.2%. The 2005-2010 period is particularly instructive: spending increased modestly from 28.7% to 30.7%, yet growth rates barely changed (1.89% to 2.00%). If the inverse hypothesis held consistently, we should observe declining growth accompanying rising s

- Evidence prioritization criteria are transparently described.
- The framing addresses causality concerns directly.
- The essay structure is designed to systematically address all Capstone-level rubric requirements for critical thinking.

 RESPONSE
{
  "thinking": "The last extraction captured the beginning of Claude's revised essay and the explanation of changes made to achieve a perfect score, but the essay is truncated and incomplete. The user request (steps 24 and 25) requires extracting all responses in both 30 and 10 seconds, which means I need to ensure the full revised essay and explanation are captured. The extract tool suggests using 'start_from_char=30000' to continue extraction from where it was truncated. To fully comply with the user's step-by-step instructions, I should extract the next segment of Claude's revised essay using this parameter, ensuring that all content is obtained before ending the session as per step 26.",
