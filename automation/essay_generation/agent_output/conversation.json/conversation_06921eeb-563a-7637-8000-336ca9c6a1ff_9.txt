 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 10 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

            11) Type this prompt, do not enter yet This is what my professor gave me as a rubric. Can you please grade this essay using this rubric? Critical thinking is a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. Evaluators are encouraged to assign a zero to any work sample or collection of work that does not meet benchmark (cell one) level performance. Explanation of issues: Capstone (4): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding. Milestone (3): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions. Milestone (2): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms.  

            12) Type this prompt, do not enter yet undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown. Benchmark (1): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated without clarification or description. Evidence (Selecting and using information to investigate a point of view or conclusion): Capstone (4): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly. Milestone (3): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning. Milestone (2): Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning. Benchmark (1): Information is taken from source(s) without any interpretation/evaluation. Viewpoints of experts are taken as. 

            13) Type this prompt, do not enter yet fact, without question. Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone.  

            14) Type this prompt, do not enter yet (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

		Additionally, social spending may affect growth through multiple channels that offset each other. While taxation to finance social programs might reduce investment incentives, the spending itself supports aggregate demand, reduces income inequality (which some research links to sustainable growth), and invests in health and education that enhance productivity. The net effect depends on institutional context, program design, and economic conditions.
		Conclusion
		The OECD data on social welfare spending and economic growth do not support the hypothesis that social service spending is inversely related to economic growth. While individual countries sometimes show negative correlations between spending and growth in specific periods, these patterns do not hold consistently across countries or time periods. More fundamentally, the data reveal that countries with high social spending levels can and do achieve substantial economic growth when other conditions are favorable.
		Contemporary peer-reviewed research reinforces this conclusion, finding that social spending often has positive or neutral effects on economic growth, particularly when examining long-term trends and accounting for spending composition. The multiplier effects documented in recent econometric studies directly contradict the inverse hypothesis, while research on welfare state regimes demonstrates that comprehensive social protection can coexist with economic dynamism and innovation.
		The apparent relationship between social spending and growth in the data reflects primarily the influence of global economic conditions, demographic factors, and country-specific circumstances rather than a causal effect of welfare expenditures constraining economic performance. The hypothesis that social service spending inversely relates to economic growth oversimplifies a complex relationship that depends critically on spending composition, institutional quality, program design, and macroeconomic context. Rather than viewing social spending and economic growth as inherently in tension, the evidence suggests they can be mutually reinforcing when social programs are well-designed and efficiently administered.

# Social Welfare Spending and Economic Growth: An Empirical Analysis

The relationship between social welfare spending and economic growth has long been a subject of intense debate among economists and policymakers. The hypothesis that "social service spending is inversely related to economic growth" suggests that higher government expenditure on social programs constrains economic expansion, potentially through crowding out private investment, reducing labor market incentives, or increasing tax burdens. This essay examines OECD data on social welfare spending as a percentage of GDP and corresponding GDP annual growth rates for multiple countries across five time periods (2000, 2005, 2010, 2016, and 2019) to evaluate whether the empirical evidence supports this inverse relationship hypothesis.

## Initial Observations from the Data

The data present a complex picture that defies simple characterization. Examining France, which maintained high social welfare spending throughout the period (ranging from 27.5% of GDP in 2000 to 31.2% in 2019), we observe substantial variation in economic growth rates. France experienced 4.14% growth in 2000 when social spending was lowest, but also achieved 2.00% growth in 2010 with spending at 30.7%. Similarly, Belgium shows 3.72% growth in 2000 at 23.5% social spending, yet achieved 2.71% growth in 2010 when spending had risen to 28.3%. These patterns suggest that the relationship is not straightforwardly inverse.

Finland presents a particularly striking case. The country experienced its highest growth rate of 5.75% in 2000 when social spending stood at 22.6%, but also achieved 3.17% growth in 2010 when spending had increased to 27.4%. The decline to 1.35% growth by 2019, despite social spending decreasing slightly to 28.7%, further complicates any simple inverse relationship narrative. These variations suggest that factors beyond social spending levels—such as global economic conditions, technological changes, and demographic shifts—play significant roles in determining growth outcomes.

## Evidence Against the Simple Inverse Hypothesis

Multiple lines of evidence from the data challenge the hypothesis of a straightforward inverse relationship. First, cross-sectional analysis reveals that countries with similar social spending levels often experience divergent growth rates. Second, temporal patterns within individual countries show that increases in social spending do not necessarily coincide with decreased growth, and in some instances may even correspond with economic expansion.

The Nordic model provides instructive evidence. Finland's experience demonstrates that economies can sustain relatively high social spending while achieving substantial growth when other conditions are favorable. The 2000-2010 period shows Finland growing at 3.17% with social spending at 27.4%, challenging the notion that welfare expenditures inherently constrain economic performance. This aligns with recent empirical research showing that comprehensive welfare states, particularly in Nordic countries, have successfully combined high social spending with innovation leadership and economic competitiveness.

Furthermore, examining the 2010 data across all countries reveals an interesting pattern: many nations experienced moderate growth despite elevated social spending in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Belgium achieved 2.71% growth with 28.3% social spending, while France reached 2.00% at 30.7%. These figures suggest that social spending may have served a stabilizing function during economic turbulence, contradicting the hypothesis that it uniformly impedes growth.

## Contemporary Scholarly Evidence

Recent peer-reviewed research provides crucial context for interpreting these data patterns. Furceri and Zdzienicka's (2012) comprehensive study of OECD countries found that social spending has a significant positive effect on economic output, with a 1% increase in social spending raising GDP by approximately 0.1 percentage points, corresponding to a multiplier of 0.6. This directly contradicts the inverse relationship hypothesis, suggesting instead that social expenditures can stimulate economic activity through various channels including consumption support, human capital development, and automatic stabilization during downturns.

The composition of social spending matters significantly. Research indicates that expenditures on education and health—both components of the broader social welfare category—generate particularly strong positive effects on growth by enhancing human capital. Studies have demonstrated that public education spending promotes productivity growth, with improvements in educational attainment accounting for substantial portions of economic expansion in developed nations. Similarly, healthcare expenditures that reduce mortality, improve workforce health, and extend productive lifespans contribute to long-term economic performance.

However, the empirical literature also acknowledges complexity and conditional effects. Some studies find that while aggregate social spending may show weak or mixed correlations with growth, specific components exhibit different patterns. Pension expenditures, for instance, may have more ambiguous effects on growth compared to education or active labor market spending. Additionally, research using panel data from welfare state economies has documented that institutional quality, efficiency of administration, and the specific design of social programs significantly moderate the relationship between spending and growth.

## The Role of Global Economic Conditions

A critical limitation of the simple inverse hypothesis is its failure to account for macroeconomic context. The data span a period of extraordinary economic volatility, including the dot-com boom (2000), pre-crisis expansion (2005), post-financial crisis recovery (2010), and mature recovery periods (2016, 2019). Growth rates during these periods reflect global conditions that affect all countries regardless of their social spending levels.

The 2010 figures are particularly revealing. Most countries show depressed growth rates compared to 2000 and 2005, reflecting the aftermath of the Great Recession. France, Belgium, and Finland all experienced slower growth in this period, but this pattern reflects the global economic downturn rather than autonomous effects of their social welfare systems. Indeed, research on automatic stabilizers suggests that social spending may have moderated the severity of the recession by maintaining household incomes and aggregate demand.

Moreover, the variation in growth rates between 2016 and 2019 appears more influenced by country-specific factors and European economic conditions than by changes in social spending levels, which remained relatively stable during this period. Belgium's 2.44% growth in 2019 and Finland's 1.35% likely reflect differences in export competitiveness, demographic structures, and industrial composition rather than their nearly identical social spending levels (28.9% and 28.7% respectively).

## Alternative Interpretations and Mechanisms

Rather than a simple inverse relationship, the evidence suggests several alternative theoretical frameworks better explain the data. First, the relationship may be non-linear, with moderate levels of social spending supporting growth through human capital development and social cohesion, while only extreme levels potentially constrain economic performance. Second, the direction of causality may be bidirectional, with economic growth enabling higher social spending rather than spending constraining growth.

Recent empirical work on welfare models and economic performance indicates that comprehensive social protection systems can coexist with strong economic outcomes when well-designed. The Nordic countries have long demonstrated that extensive welfare states need not undermine competitiveness or innovation. Their success suggests that factors such as labor market flexibility, educational quality, and innovation policy matter more than aggregate spending levels.

Additionally, social spending may affect growth through multiple channels that offset each other. While taxation to finance social programs might reduce investment incentives, the spending itself supports aggregate demand, reduces income inequality (which some research links to sustainable growth), and invests in health and education that enhance productivity. The net effect depends on institutional context, program design, and economic conditions.

## Conclusion

The OECD data on social welfare spending and economic growth do not support the hypothesis that social service spending is inversely related to economic growth. While individual countries sometimes show negative correlations between spending and growth in specific periods, these patterns do not hold consistently across countries or time periods.
