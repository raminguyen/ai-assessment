 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 4 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.
</reasoning_rules>

            11) Type this prompt, do not enter yet This is what my professor gave me as a rubric. Can you please grade this essay using this rubric? Critical thinking is a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. Evaluators are encouraged to assign a zero to any work sample or collection of work that does not meet benchmark (cell one) level performance. Explanation of issues: Capstone (4): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding. Milestone (3): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions. Milestone (2): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown. Benchmark (1): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated without clarification or description. Evidence (Selecting and using information to investigate a point of view or conclusion): Capstone (4): Information is taken from source(s) with enough. 
            
            12) Type this prompt, do not enter yet interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly. Milestone (3): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning. Milestone (2): Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning. Benchmark (1): Information is taken from source(s) without any interpretation/evaluation. Viewpoints of experts are taken as fact, without question. Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins.

            13) Type this prompt, do not enter yet to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

			Conditioning and Social Learning in Professor Catlove’s Morning Routine
			When Professor Catlove opens a can of cat food each morning, the seemingly simple scene of purring, meowing cats twining around his legs actually reflects several fundamental principles of learning psychology. Classical conditioning, operant conditioning, and social learning each offer explanatory power for understanding both the cats’ and the professor’s behaviors. By examining how these learning processes may be operating simultaneously, we can better understand the dynamic behavioral patterns that emerge through daily human–animal interactions.
			Classical Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior
			Classical conditioning, first systematically described by Ivan Pavlov, occurs when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus (US) that naturally elicits an unconditioned response (UR). Over repeated pairings, the previously neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS), capable of eliciting a conditioned response (CR). In Professor Catlove’s kitchen, the sound of the can opener likely serves as a conditioned stimulus. Originally, the sound would have held no significance for the cats. However, because it repeatedly precedes the presentation of food—an unconditioned stimulus that naturally produces salivation, excitement, and approach behaviors—the sound alone eventually triggers the same responses.
			The cats’ purring, meowing, and rapid approach into the kitchen are consistent with conditioned responses. Importantly, these responses reflect anticipatory behavior: the animals are reacting to what the sound predicts rather than the food itself. Their behavior demonstrates stimulus substitution, in which the conditioned stimulus takes on some of the motivational power of the unconditioned stimulus. Even subtle cues—such as the professor’s footsteps at a particular time of morning or the rustle of the food cabinet—may have become secondary conditioned stimuli through higher-order conditioning. Over time, the cats likely respond not only to the can opener but also to any environmental signal reliably associated with feeding.
			Classical Conditioning in the Professor’s Behavior
			Although the cats’ reactions present the most obvious example of classical conditioning, Professor Catlove himself may also be classically conditioned. Each morning, the professor experiences warmth, affection, and social reinforcement when his cats rush toward him. Their purring and rubbing behaviors function as unconditioned stimuli that naturally elicit pleasant emotional responses in humans. As a result, the sound of the can opening—or even the sight of the unopened can—may become conditioned stimuli for the professor, eliciting feelings of affection, anticipation, or satisfaction before any feline interaction takes place.
			This reciprocal conditioning illustrates bidirectional learning common in human–pet relationships. Just as the cats associate the professor’s actions with feeding, the professor may associate certain aspects of the routine with emotional gratification. Classical conditioning thus helps shape not only the animals’ responses but also the human’s emotional landscape.
			Operant Conditioning in the Cats’ Behavior
			Operant conditioning, described by B. F. Skinner, explains how behavior is shaped by its consequences. In the kitchen scene, the cats’ behaviors—meowing, rubbing against the professor’s legs, purring loudly—are likely reinforced by the professor’s subsequent actions. If these behaviors result in faster access to food, verbal attention, petting, or any form of positive outcome, then their frequency will increase through positive reinforcement.
			For example, if Professor Catlove habitually praises or pets the cats when they rub against him, the affectionate rubbing becomes reinforced. Even an unintentional consequence, such as opening the food can a little faster in response to persistent meowing, can reinforce vocalizing. Over time, the cats learn which behaviors are most effective in eliciting the desired response from the human food-provider.
			Negative reinforcement may also be at play. If the cats’ insistent meowing is mildly aversive to the professor and he begins preparing food more quickly to stop the noise, his behavior is negatively reinforced by the removal of the unwanted sound. Similarly, the cats may learn that performing certain behaviors reduces the delay before food arrives, reinforcing those behaviors through the removal of waiting time.
			Operant Conditioning in the Professor’s Behavior
			The professor’s actions, too, may be shaped by operant conditioning. Feeding the cats likely brings immediate relief from their meowing or pacing—removal of an aversive stimulus—which negatively reinforces his swift preparation of breakfast. Additionally, the cats’ affectionate behaviors may provide positive reinforcement for the professor’s routine. When he opens the can, he receives immediate social and emotional rewards from the cats’ enthusiastic greeting. This reinforcement likely increases the likelihood that he maintains or even hastens the breakfast routine.
			This reciprocal operant conditioning creates a feedback loop: the cats’ behaviors are reinforced by food and attention, and the professor’s behaviors are reinforced by the cats’ affection and the reduction of their demanding vocalizations. Both parties, then, are shaping and being shaped by one another.
			Social Learning Processes
			Social learning theory, particularly as described by Albert Bandura, highlights modeling, imitation, and the influence of observing others’ behavior. In this context, the cats may be learning from one another. If one cat originally discovered that running toward the professor when the can opens results in quicker access to food, other cats may have imitated this behavior after observing the outcome. Such vicarious reinforcement helps maintain group feeding routines and can lead to synchronized behavior among pets living together.
			A newly adopted cat, for instance, might initially be indifferent to the sound of the can opener. However, after observing other cats dash eagerly into the kitchen and receive food, the newcomer may learn to reproduce the same behavior. This demonstrates social facilitation, in which the presence or actions of other animals increase the likelihood of particular behaviors. Within multi-cat households, feeding time often becomes a socially learned ritual, shaped by both individual conditioning and group observation.
			The professor may also engage in social learning, though more indirectly. Cultural norms and past observations—such as how other pet owners feed or interact with their animals—may influence his approach to feeding routines. His responses to feline behavior may reflect socially learned caregiving norms or modeled approaches observed in family or media representations of pet ownership.
			Conclusion
			This seemingly simple morning feeding ritual between Professor Catlove and his cats illustrates the complexity of learning processes embedded in everyday life. Classical conditioning shapes anticipatory responses in both the cats and the professor. Operant conditioning reinforces and maintains behaviors on all sides, creating mutual feedback loops of action and consequence. Social learning contributes to the coordination and transmission of behavior among the cats and informs aspects of human caregiving practices. Together, these three learning processes interact to produce a stable, predictable, and emotionally meaningful routine for both the human and his feline companions.
