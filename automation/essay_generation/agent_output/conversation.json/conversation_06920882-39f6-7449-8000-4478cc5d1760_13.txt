 system 
You are an AI agent designed to operate in an iterative loop to automate browser tasks. Your ultimate goal is accomplishing the task provided in <user_request>.
<intro>
You excel at following tasks:
1. Navigating complex websites and extracting precise information
2. Automating form submissions and interactive web actions
3. Gathering and saving information 
4. Using your filesystem effectively to decide what to keep in your context
5. Operate effectively in an agent loop
6. Efficiently performing diverse web tasks
</intro>
<language_settings>
- Default working language: **English**
- Always respond in the same language as the user request
</language_settings>
<input>
At every step, your input will consist of: 
1. <agent_history>: A chronological event stream including your previous actions and their results.
2. <agent_state>: Current <user_request>, summary of <file_system>, <todo_contents>, and <step_info>.
3. <browser_state>: Current URL, open tabs, interactive elements indexed for actions, and visible page content.
4. <browser_vision>: Screenshot of the browser with bounding boxes around interactive elements. If you used screenshot before, this will contain a screenshot.
5. <read_state> This will be displayed only if your previous action was extract or read_file. This data is only shown in the current step.
</input>
<agent_history>
Agent history will be given as a list of step information as follows:
<step_{step_number}>:
Evaluation of Previous Step: Assessment of last action
Memory: Your memory of this step
Next Goal: Your goal for this step
Action Results: Your actions and their results
</step_{step_number}>
and system messages wrapped in <sys> tag.
</agent_history>
<user_request>
USER REQUEST: This is your ultimate objective and always remains visible.
- This has the highest priority. Make the user happy.
- If the user request is very specific - then carefully follow each step and dont skip or hallucinate steps.
- If the task is open ended you can plan yourself how to get it done.
</user_request>
<browser_state>
1. Browser State will be given as:
Current URL: URL of the page you are currently viewing.
Open Tabs: Open tabs with their ids.
Interactive Elements: All interactive elements will be provided in format as [index]<type>text</type> where
- index: Numeric identifier for interaction
- type: HTML element type (button, input, etc.)
- text: Element description
Examples:
[33]<div>User form</div>
\t*[35]<button aria-label='Submit form'>Submit</button>
Note that:
- Only elements with numeric indexes in [] are interactive
- (stacked) indentation (with \t) is important and means that the element is a (html) child of the element above (with a lower index)
- Elements tagged with a star `*[` are the new interactive elements that appeared on the website since the last step - if url has not changed. Your previous actions caused that change. Think if you need to interact with them, e.g. after input you might need to select the right option from the list.
- Pure text elements without [] are not interactive.
</browser_state>
<browser_vision>
If you used screenshot before, you will be provided with a screenshot of the current page with  bounding boxes around interactive elements. This is your GROUND TRUTH: reason about the image in your thinking to evaluate your progress.
If an interactive index inside your browser_state does not have text information, then the interactive index is written at the top center of it's element in the screenshot.
Use screenshot if you are unsure or simply want more information.
</browser_vision>
<browser_rules>
Strictly follow these rules while using the browser and navigating the web:
- Only interact with elements that have a numeric [index] assigned.
- Only use indexes that are explicitly provided.
- If research is needed, open a **new tab** instead of reusing the current one.
- If the page changes after, for example, an input text action, analyse if you need to interact with new elements, e.g. selecting the right option from the list.
- By default, only elements in the visible viewport are listed. Use scrolling tools if you suspect relevant content is offscreen which you need to interact with. Scroll ONLY if there are more pixels below or above the page.
- You can scroll by a specific number of pages using the pages parameter (e.g., 0.5 for half page, 2.0 for two pages).
- If a captcha appears, attempt solving it if possible. If not, use fallback strategies (e.g., alternative site, backtrack).
- If expected elements are missing, try refreshing, scrolling, or navigating back.
- If the page is not fully loaded, use the wait action.
- You can call extract on specific pages to gather structured semantic information from the entire page, including parts not currently visible.
- Call extract only if the information you are looking for is not visible in your <browser_state> otherwise always just use the needed text from the <browser_state>.
- Calling the extract tool is expensive! DO NOT query the same page with the same extract query multiple times. Make sure that you are on the page with relevant information based on the screenshot before calling this tool.
- If you fill an input field and your action sequence is interrupted, most often something changed e.g. suggestions popped up under the field.
- If the action sequence was interrupted in previous step due to page changes, make sure to complete any remaining actions that were not executed. For example, if you tried to input text and click a search button but the click was not executed because the page changed, you should retry the click action in your next step.
- If the <user_request> includes specific page information such as product type, rating, price, location, etc., try to apply filters to be more efficient.
- The <user_request> is the ultimate goal. If the user specifies explicit steps, they have always the highest priority.
- If you input into a field, you might need to press enter, click the search button, or select from dropdown for completion.
- Don't login into a page if you don't have to. Don't login if you don't have the credentials. 
- There are 2 types of tasks always first think which type of request you are dealing with:
1. Very specific step by step instructions:
- Follow them as very precise and don't skip steps. Try to complete everything as requested.
2. Open ended tasks. Plan yourself, be creative in achieving them.
- If you get stuck e.g. with logins or captcha in open-ended tasks you can re-evaluate the task and try alternative ways, e.g. sometimes accidentally login pops up, even though there some part of the page is accessible or you get some information via web search.
- If you reach a PDF viewer, the file is automatically downloaded and you can see its path in <available_file_paths>. You can either read the file or scroll in the page to see more.
</browser_rules>
<file_system>
- You have access to a persistent file system which you can use to track progress, store results, and manage long tasks.
- Your file system is initialized with a `todo.md`: Use this to keep a checklist for known subtasks. Use `replace_file` tool to update markers in `todo.md` as first action whenever you complete an item. This file should guide your step-by-step execution when you have a long running task.
- If you are writing a `csv` file, make sure to use double quotes if cell elements contain commas.
- If the file is too large, you are only given a preview of your file. Use `read_file` to see the full content if necessary.
- If exists, <available_file_paths> includes files you have downloaded or uploaded by the user. You can only read or upload these files but you don't have write access.
- If the task is really long, initialize a `results.md` file to accumulate your results.
- DO NOT use the file system if the task is less than 10 steps!
</file_system>
<task_completion_rules>
You must call the `done` action in one of two cases:
- When you have fully completed the USER REQUEST.
- When you reach the final allowed step (`max_steps`), even if the task is incomplete.
- If it is ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE to continue.
The `done` action is your opportunity to terminate and share your findings with the user.
- Set `success` to `true` only if the full USER REQUEST has been completed with no missing components.
- If any part of the request is missing, incomplete, or uncertain, set `success` to `false`.
- You can use the `text` field of the `done` action to communicate your findings and `files_to_display` to send file attachments to the user, e.g. `["results.md"]`.
- Put ALL the relevant information you found so far in the `text` field when you call `done` action.
- Combine `text` and `files_to_display` to provide a coherent reply to the user and fulfill the USER REQUEST.
- You are ONLY ALLOWED to call `done` as a single action. Don't call it together with other actions.
- If the user asks for specified format, such as "return JSON with following structure", "return a list of format...", MAKE sure to use the right format in your answer.
- If the user asks for a structured output, your `done` action's schema will be modified. Take this schema into account when solving the task!
</task_completion_rules>
<action_rules>
- You are allowed to use a maximum of 4 actions per step.
If you are allowed multiple actions, you can specify multiple actions in the list to be executed sequentially (one after another).
- If the page changes after an action, the sequence is interrupted and you get the new state.
</action_rules>
<efficiency_guidelines>
You can output multiple actions in one step. Try to be efficient where it makes sense. Do not predict actions which do not make sense for the current page.
**Recommended Action Combinations:**
- `input` + `click` → Fill form field and submit/search in one step
- `input` + `input` → Fill multiple form fields
- `click` + `click` → Navigate through multi-step flows (when the page does not navigate between clicks)
- `scroll` with pages 10 + `extract` → Scroll to the bottom of the page to load more content before extracting structured data
- File operations + browser actions
Do not try multiple different paths in one step. Always have one clear goal per step.
Its important that you see in the next step if your action was successful, so do not chain actions which change the browser state multiple times, e.g.
- do not use click and then navigate, because you would not see if the click was successful or not.
- or do not use switch and switch together, because you would not see the state in between.
- do not use input and then scroll, because you would not see if the input was successful or not.
</efficiency_guidelines>
<reasoning_rules>
You must reason explicitly and systematically at every step in your `thinking` block.
Exhibit the following reasoning patterns to successfully achieve the <user_request>:
- Reason about <agent_history> to track progress and context toward <user_request>.
- Analyze the most recent "Next Goal" and "Action Result" in <agent_history> and clearly state what you previously tried to achieve.
- Analyze all relevant items in <agent_history>, <browser_state>, <read_state>, <file_system>, <read_state> and the screenshot to understand your state.
- Explicitly judge success/failure/uncertainty of the last action. Never assume an action succeeded just because it appears to be executed in your last step in <agent_history>. For example, you might have "Action 1/1: Input '2025-05-05' into element 3." in your history even though inputting text failed. Always verify using <browser_vision> (screenshot) as the primary ground truth. If a screenshot is unavailable, fall back to <browser_state>. If the expected change is missing, mark the last action as failed (or uncertain) and plan a recovery.
- If todo.md is empty and the task is multi-step, generate a stepwise plan in todo.md using file tools.
- Analyze `todo.md` to guide and track your progress.
- If any todo.md items are finished, mark them as complete in the file.
- Analyze whether you are stuck, e.g. when you repeat the same actions multiple times without any progress. Then consider alternative approaches e.g. scrolling for more context or send_keys to interact with keys directly or different pages.
- Analyze the <read_state> where one-time information are displayed due to your previous action. Reason about whether you want to keep this information in memory and plan writing them into a file if applicable using the file tools.
- If you see information relevant to <user_request>, plan saving the information into a file.
- Before writing data into a file, analyze the <file_system> and check if the file already has some content to avoid overwriting.
- Decide what concise, actionable context should be stored in memory to inform future reasoning.
- When ready to finish, state you are preparing to call done and communicate completion/results to the user.
- Before done, use read_file to verify file contents intended for user output.
- Always reason about the <user_request>. Make sure to carefully analyze the specific steps and information required. E.g. specific filters, specific form fields, specific information to search. Make sure to always compare the current trajactory with the user request and think carefully if thats how the user requested it.

            11) Paste this prompt This is what my professor gave me as a rubric. Can you please grade this essay using this rubric? Critical thinking is a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion. Evaluators are encouraged to assign a zero to any work sample or collection of work that does not meet benchmark (cell one) level performance. Explanation of issues: Capstone (4): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated clearly and described comprehensively, delivering all relevant information necessary for full understanding. Milestone (3): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated, described, and clarified so that understanding is not seriously impeded by omissions. Milestone (2): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated but description leaves some terms undefined, ambiguities unexplored, boundaries undetermined, and/or backgrounds unknown. Benchmark (1): Issue/problem to be considered critically is stated without clarification or description. Evidence (Selecting and using information to investigate a point of view or conclusion): Capstone (4): Information is taken from source(s) with enough.
            
            12) Paste this prompt interpretation/evaluation to develop a comprehensive analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are questioned thoroughly. Milestone (3): Information is taken from source(s) with enough interpretation/evaluation to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are subject to questioning. Milestone (2): Information is taken from source(s) with some interpretation/evaluation, but not enough to develop a coherent analysis or synthesis. Viewpoints of experts are taken as mostly fact, with little questioning. Benchmark (1): Information is taken from source(s) without any interpretation/evaluation. Viewpoints of experts are taken as fact, without question. Influence of context and assumptions: Capstone (4): Thoroughly (systematically and methodically) analyzes own and others' assumptions and carefully evaluates the relevance of contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (3): Identifies own and others' assumptions and several relevant contexts when presenting a position. Milestone (2): Questions some assumptions. Identifies several relevant contexts when presenting a position. May be more aware of others' assumptions than one's own (or vice versa). Benchmark (1): Shows an emerging awareness of present assumptions (sometimes labels assertions as assumptions). Begins.
            
            13) Paste this prompt to identify some contexts when presenting a position. Student's position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis): Capstone (4): Specific position (perspective, thesis/hypothesis) is imaginative, taking into account the complexities of an issue. Limits of position are acknowledged. Others' points of view are synthesized within position. Milestone (3): Specific position takes into account the complexities of an issue. Others' points of view are acknowledged within position. Milestone (2): Specific position acknowledges different sides of an issue. Benchmark (1): Specific position is stated, but is simplistic and obvious. Conclusions and related outcomes (implications and consequences): Capstone (4): Conclusions and related outcomes are logical and reflect student’s informed evaluation and ability to place evidence and perspectives discussed in priority order. Milestone (3): Conclusion is logically tied to a range of information, including opposing viewpoints; related outcomes are identified clearly. Milestone (2): Conclusion is logically tied to information (because information is chosen to fit the desired conclusion); some related outcomes are identified clearly. Benchmark (1): Conclusion is inconsistently tied to some of the information discussed; related outcomes are oversimplified..

			Italy
			: As spending increased from 22.6% (2000) to ~29% (2016), Italy’s growth rates remained low. Yet Italy’s stagnation predates spending increases and is driven by structural productivity challenges (Rodrik, 2018).
			Overall, the within-country patterns largely
			contradict
			the hypothesis.
			V. Interpreting the Mixed Evidence
			The data do not support a strong inverse relationship. Instead, they align with broader empirical research showing that welfare spending’s effect on growth depends on institutional and structural characteristics rather than expenditure levels alone.
			Peer-reviewed studies support this interpretation:
			Lindert (2004) finds that high-spending welfare states like Sweden and Denmark have grown robustly due to efficient program design and high labor participation rates.
			Arjona, Ladaique, and Pearson (2003) find that social spending that improves human capital (education, health) tends to support growth.
			Alesina, Glaeser, and Sacerdote (2001) note no systematic evidence that social spending reduces economic performance across OECD countries.
			Piketty et al. (2020) emphasize that redistribution can coexist with strong economic performance, depending on tax structure and labor institutions.
			These findings echo the mixed patterns visible in the provided data.
			VI. Conclusion: To What Extent Does the Data Support the Hypothesis?
			The attached economic data provide
			little support
			for the hypothesis that “social service spending is inversely related to economic growth.” Although one country—Italy—fits the predicted pattern, most do not. High-spending countries such as Sweden, Belgium, and France display growth rates comparable to or exceeding those of lower-spending countries. Within countries, increases in welfare spending do not correspond to decreases in growth; instead, GDP growth fluctuates independently of welfare expenditure.
			Therefore, based on the evidence provided, the hypothesis is
			not supported
			. The relationship between social service spending and economic growth is evidently influenced by broader institutional, structural, and macroeconomic factors that cannot be captured merely by comparing spending levels to growth rates. The data reinforce the broader scholarly consensus that welfare spending is not inherently detrimental to economic growth, and in some cases may coexist with, or even contribute to, strong economic performance.

The full response from ChatGPT regarding the essay on social service spending and economic growth is as follows:

**To What Extent Do the Data Support the Hypothesis that “Social Service Spending Is Inversely Related to Economic Growth”?**

The relationship between social service spending and economic growth has long been debated in economic literature. Advocates of higher welfare expenditures argue that social spending promotes long-run productivity by stabilizing households, investing in human capital, and reducing inequality. Critics counter that high social spending distorts labor incentives, increases taxation, and suppresses private-sector investment. The attached economic data present historical values of social welfare spending as a percentage of GDP for ten OECD countries alongside annual GDP growth rates for corresponding years (2000, 2005, 2010, 2016, 2019). To evaluate whether these data support the hypothesis that “social service spending is inversely related to economic growth,” this essay provides a verbal, evidence-based analysis, examining whether higher welfare spending levels are consistently associated with lower GDP growth.

**I. Conceptual Background: Why Social Spending Might or Might Not Inhibit Growth**
Economic theory offers competing predictions. On one hand, high social spending often requires higher taxation, which can suppress investment and reduce labor supply (Barro, 1991). Welfare programs may also reduce incentives to work or save, potentially slowing long-run growth. From this perspective, one may expect a negative correlation between welfare spending and GDP growth.
On the other hand, welfare states improve health, education, and income security, all of which can enhance workforce productivity (Lindert, 2004). By stabilizing demand during downturns, they also cushion business cycles. Empirically, cross-national studies find that the relationship is ambiguous: some types of social spending foster growth, while others may hinder it (OECD, 2019). Thus, the hypothesis of an inverse relationship is not theoretically predetermined; rather, it must be tested empirically.

**II. Overview of the Attached Data**
The data include welfare spending (as % of GDP) and GDP growth rates for France, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Sweden, Germany, Norway, and Spain. Several countries—France, Belgium, Finland, Italy, and Denmark—consistently maintain high welfare spending levels above 28% of GDP in recent decades. Others—Germany, Norway, and Spain—spend less, within the 19–26% range depending on the year.
GDP growth varies substantially across years and countries, ranging from near-zero growth (Italy in 2019: 0.43%) to notably high growth (Sweden in 2010: 5.75%). If the hypothesis is correct, we would expect countries with higher spending shares to exhibit lower growth, and years with higher spending should display lower growth within each country.
However, a close reading of the data reveals a more complex pattern.

**III. Cross-Country Comparison: Do High-Spending Countries Grow More Slowly?**
If an inverse relationship exists, the highest spenders—France, Belgium, Finland, and Italy—should consistently show the weakest growth. The data show some alignment with this prediction, but also prominent counterexamples.

**Countries that fit the hypothesis imperfectly**
- **Italy**: High spending (28–29%) and consistently low GDP growth (0.43–1.53% in most years). Italy fits the inverse relationship strongly; however, Italy’s low growth also reflects structural economic stagnation independent of welfare expenditure (Boeri & Garibaldi, 2019).
- **France**: Very high spending (31–32%) but not consistently low growth. In 2000, France grew by 4.14%, higher than lower-spending Norway (3.32%). In 2019, France (2.02%) outperformed Germany (0.99%), despite much higher welfare spending.

**Countries that contradict the inverse relationship**
- **Sweden**: Spending around 26–27% but very high growth in 2010 (5.75%) and 2019 (2.55%). Sweden’s strong performance challenges the notion that high welfare spending suppresses growth.
- **Belgium**: High spending (around 28–29%) but respectable growth (2.44% in 2019, exceeding Germany, Norway, and Italy).
In sum, while one or two high-spending countries (notably Italy) show chronically weak growth, others (Sweden, Belgium, France) do not. This suggests that cross-country differences in growth cannot be explained by social spending alone.

**IV. Within-Country Comparison: Does Growth Decline When Spending Rises?**
If the hypothesis were true, changes in spending over time should correlate with changes in growth within each country. Yet the data generally do not show this.

**Examples contradicting the hypothesis**
- **Finland**: Social spending rose from 22.6% (2000) to 30.8% (2016), yet growth increased from 2.78% to 2.57% over the same period, and peaked at 5.75% in 2010 when spending was intermediate.
- **France**: Spending grew steadily, but growth fluctuated without a clear downward trend.
- **Germany**: Spending remained relatively stable (~25–26%)
