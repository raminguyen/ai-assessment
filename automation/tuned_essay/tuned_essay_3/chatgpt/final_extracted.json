  "result": "**Final Grade:** 20 / 20 (Capstone Level)\n\n**Detailed Feedback:**\n\n**1. Explanation of Issues – Score: 4 (Capstone)**\n*   **Feedback:** The essay defines the issue clearly, analyzing Boston’s 2024 real estate market through housing, industrial, office, and life-science sectors. It gives full context (macro trends, hybrid work, capital tightening) and uses both local and academic data. The explanation is detailed enough for readers unfamiliar with real estate to grasp the market dynamics.\n*   **Strength:** Comprehensive coverage across sectors, supported by clear evidence.\n*   **Improvement Tip:** A brief framing sentence at the start could highlight why this analysis matters (e.g., “Real estate signals Boston’s economic resilience…”).\n\n**2. Evidence (Selecting and Using Information) – Score: 4 (Capstone)**\n*   **Feedback:** The essay integrates at least five peer-reviewed sources (Saiz, Gupta, Geltner, etc.) with strong synthesis between data and interpretation. It uses citations to explain phenomena (e.g., hybrid work → office value decline). Expert viewpoints are interpreted rather than accepted blindly.\n*   **Strength:** Excellent connection between scholarly evidence and observed 2024 trends.\n*   **Improvement Tip:** Slightly more comparison across studies (e.g., contrast national vs. Boston-specific outcomes) would deepen synthesis.\n\n**3. Influence of Context and Assumptions – Score: 4 (Capstone)**\n*   **Feedback:** The essay systematically analyzes assumptions — such as capital market discipline, geographic constraints, and the persistence of hybrid work. It also recognizes context (post-pandemic recovery, supply regulation, investor sentiment).\n*   **Strength:** Balanced awareness of macroeconomic and local contexts.\n*   **Improvement Tip:** Make your assumptions explicit (“This assumes rate stability through 2025…”).\n\n**4. Student’s Position (Perspective/Thesis) – Score: 4 (Capstone)**\n*   **Feedback:** The position is imaginative and well-reasoned — that Boston rewards “cautious, operationally skilled investors leaning into supply-constrained, high-quality assets.” It integrates diverse perspectives (developers, lenders, tenants). Limits of the position are acknowledged (e.g., bifurcation in office and lab demand).\n*   **Strength:** Thoughtful synthesis of complex stakeholder viewpoints.\n*   **Improvement Tip:** Could include a counter-argument briefly (e.g., skeptics predicting further office distress).\n\n**5. Conclusions and Related Outcomes – Score: 4 (Capstone)**\n*   **Feedback:** The conclusion logically connects all discussed evidence and clearly ranks opportunities: workforce housing, infill industrial, office-to-lab, and condo infill. It explains why each makes sense within the 2024–2025 context. Implications (capital discipline, policy constraints) are realistic.\n*   **Strength:** Conclusions flow naturally from your analysis.\n*   **Improvement Tip:** Add a brief projection statement (“Looking ahead to 2025–2026, these factors suggest…”).\n\n**Performance Summary:**\nYour essay meets all Capstone criteria across the AAC&U rubric — comprehensive issue framing, evidence-based reasoning, clear recognition of assumptions and context, strong analytical position, and logical conclusions. It reads like a professional market brief rather than a student paper."
